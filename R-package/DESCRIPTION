Title: eXtreme Gradient Boosting
Version: 0.3-4
Date: 2014-12-28
Description: Xgboost is short for eXtreme Gradient Boosting, which is an 
    efficient and scalable implementation of the gradient boosting framework. 
    This package is an R wrapper of xgboost. The package includes an efficient 
    linear model solver and tree learning algorithms. The package can automatically 
    do parallel computation on a single machine which could be more than 10 times faster
    than existing gradient boosting packages. It supports various
    objective functions, including regression, classification and ranking. The
    package is made to be extensible, so that users are also allowed to define
    their own objectives easily.
